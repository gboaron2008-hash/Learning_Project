# Simple Python Project

This small project prints "Hello, World!" and demonstrates a VS Code "Run and Debug" configuration.

Run locally:

```powershell
python main.py
```

In VS Code: open the workspace and use the Run and Debug view. Start the `Python: Run main.py` configuration to run `main.py` inside the integrated terminal.
